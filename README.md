## Weather-er
(-er doesn't mean a thing)

A react-built application. You can check out the weather forecast for a couple of days ahead. The app can be started as any create-react-app based react application (clone -> npm start).

## Features:
- A pop-up allowing you to choose any city you want
- A weather up to 10 days ahead (according to the API). Currently there are 4 days availiable but the expansion is only a matter of design capabilities.
- A brief information about precipitation on each day

## To-do list:
 - Get rid of some problems which can take place due to particular situations
 - Add a fahrenheit scale in addition.
 - Add a choice to select how many days should be forecasted
